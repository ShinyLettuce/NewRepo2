Bee Game

Group Members (roles):
Erik Nikiforov (Quality Assurance)
Jacob Engelhardt (Lead Programmer)
Nom KÃ¶hler (Art Design and Graphics Programmer)

The game is based on Sokoban clone by lawric (https://lawric.itch.io/sokoban).
The player controls a bee and the goal of each level is to push flowers into flower places.
The game has five different levels, each one getting progressively harder and introducing one new mechanic of the game, represented by the yellow tile.

Tile based game play mechanics, movements and the main menu were based on Jacob's initial code.
Art and texture loading were based on Nom's initial code.
Logic of level's flower data storage, flower movement and victory conditions were based on Erik's initial code.
In the end product, every group member had a role on optimizing and merging additions to match the wanted outcome.
All levels were based on (insert original idea) and optimized by each group member.


Controls:
Arrow keys - move the bee
Delete - restart the level
Home - return to the level selection screen

Tiles:
Brown - moveable by the bee and flowers
Yellow - moveable only by the bee
Orange - unmoveable

All art used in the game is made by Nom.

Sound Design:
Bee's movement - Nom's voice
